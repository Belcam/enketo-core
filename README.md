Under massice re-construction, see the [requirejs branch](https://github.com/martijnr/enketo-core/tree/requirejs/README.md). 

It will be considered stable when [this milestone](https://github.com/MartijnR/enketo-core/issues?milestone=1&state=open) is reached, after which the requirejs branch will be merged with master.

If you want to start using enketo-core now, I strongly advice to use the requirejs branch and not master.
